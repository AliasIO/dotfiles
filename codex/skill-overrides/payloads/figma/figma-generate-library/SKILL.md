# Design System Builder — Figma MCP Skill

Build professional-grade design systems in Figma that match code. Use the smallest workflow that completes the requested component or library, applying relevant quality patterns from established design systems.

**Prerequisites**: The `figma-use` skill MUST also be loaded for every `use_figma` call. It provides Plugin API syntax rules (return pattern, page reset, ID return, font loading, color range). This skill provides design system domain knowledge and workflow orchestration.

**Always include `figma-generate-library` in the comma-separated `skillNames` parameter when calling `use_figma` as part of this skill. If this skill was loaded via an MCP resource, you MUST prefix the name with `resource:` (e.g. `resource:figma-generate-library`).** This is a logging parameter — it does not affect execution.

## 1. Choose the scope

For a single component or local edit, inspect that component and relevant tokens, apply only the requested change, then verify structure and rendering. Reuse existing pages, collections and naming. Do not create a full library, require a Phase 0 approval, or prescribe a minimum call count for this route.

For a library-scale request, use the phases below as a dependency order. Keep progress concise and proportional to the work. Ask only when an unresolved design decision or additional authority matters, carrying forward the user’s existing choices. No fixed checklist format, task-ID scheme or minimum number of tool calls is required. Batch independent operations when supported; keep dependent/fragile steps sequential and inspect their results.

## 2. Library-scale workflow

Use only the phases needed for the requested scope, reusing existing foundations. Complete relevant dependencies and validation before claiming success. If a required check is blocked, report the exact limitation; continue independent work and do not misrepresent unverified design state.

### Phase 0: DISCOVERY (always first — no `use_figma` writes yet)

- [ ] 0a. Analyze codebase → extract tokens, components, naming conventions
- [ ] 0b. Inspect Figma file → pages, variables, components, styles, existing conventions
- [ ] 0c. Discover and search libraries → call `get_libraries` for the target file before `search_design_system`
- [ ] 0d. Lock v1 scope → exact token set + component list recorded before any creation
- [ ] 0e. Map code → Figma → every conflict (code disagrees with Figma) resolved and recorded
- [ ] 0f. Print a **gap analysis** to chat: what exists in code but not Figma, what exists in Figma but not code, and every conflict from 0e with its resolution

### Phase 1: FOUNDATIONS (tokens first — always before components)

- [ ] 1a. Create variable collections and modes
- [ ] 1b. Create primitive variables (raw values, 1 mode)
- [ ] 1c. Create semantic variables (aliased to primitives, mode-aware)
- [ ] 1d. Set scopes on ALL variables (never `ALL_SCOPES`)
- [ ] 1e. Set code syntax on ALL variables
- [ ] 1f. Create effect styles (shadows) and text styles (typography)
- [ ] 1g. Print a **variable summary** to chat: N collections, M variables, K modes, broken down by collection
- [ ] 1h. Print the **style list** to chat: every effect style and text style created, with names
- [ ] Exit criteria met: every token from the agreed plan exists, all scopes set, all code syntax set

### Phase 2: FILE STRUCTURE (before components)

- [ ] 2a. Create page skeleton: Cover → Getting Started → Foundations → --- → Components → --- → Utilities
- [ ] 2b. Create foundations documentation pages (color swatches, type specimens, spacing bars)
- [ ] 2c. Capture a `get_screenshot` of every foundations page and print the **page list** to chat alongside the screenshots
- [ ] Exit criteria met: all planned pages exist, foundations docs are navigable

### Phase 3: COMPONENTS (one at a time — never batch)

For EACH component (in dependency order: atoms before molecules), run the checklist below. Finish the current component before starting the next.

- [ ] 3a. Create dedicated page
- [ ] 3b. Build base component with auto-layout + full variable bindings
- [ ] 3c. Create all variant combinations (`combineAsVariants` + grid layout)
- [ ] 3d. Add component properties (TEXT, BOOLEAN, INSTANCE_SWAP)
- [ ] 3e. Link properties to child nodes
- [ ] 3f. Add page documentation (title, description, usage notes)
- [ ] 3g. Validate: `get_metadata` (structure) + `get_screenshot` (visual)
- [ ] 3h. Optional: lightweight Code Connect mapping while context is fresh
- [ ] Exit criteria met: variant count correct, all bindings verified, screenshot looks right

### Phase 4: INTEGRATION + QA (final pass)

- [ ] 4a. Finalize all Code Connect mappings
- [ ] 4b. Accessibility audit (contrast, min touch targets, focus visibility)
- [ ] 4c. Naming audit (no duplicates, no unnamed nodes, consistent casing)
- [ ] 4d. Unresolved bindings audit (no hardcoded fills/strokes remaining)
- [ ] 4e. Final review screenshots of every page

## 3. Critical Rules

**Plugin API basics** (from use_figma skill — enforced here too):
- Use `return` to send data back (auto-serialized). Do NOT wrap in IIFE or call closePlugin.
- Return ALL created/mutated node IDs in every return value
- Page context resets each call — always `await figma.setCurrentPageAsync(page)` at start. **Call it at most once per script**: each component or doc page is its own `use_figma` call. Never loop over `figma.root.children` and switch pages inside a mutating script — split that work into one focused call per target page (see [figma-use → gotchas.md → Set current page once per `use_figma` call](../figma-use/references/gotchas.md#set-current-page-once-per-use_figma-call--split-multi-page-work-across-calls))
- `figma.notify()` throws — never use it
- Colors are 0–1 range, not 0–255
- Font MUST be loaded before any text write: `await figma.loadFontAsync({family, style})`. Use `await figma.listAvailableFontsAsync()` to discover available fonts and verify exact style strings — if a load fails, query available fonts to find the correct name or a fallback.

**Design system rules**:
1. **Variables BEFORE components** — components bind to variables. No token = no component.
2. **Inspect before creating** — run read-only `use_figma` to discover existing conventions. Match them.
3. **One page per component** *(default)* — exception: tightly related families (e.g., Input + helpers) may share a page with clear section separation.
4. **Bind visual properties to variables** *(default)* — fills, strokes, padding, radius, gap. Exceptions: intentionally fixed geometry (icon pixel-grid sizes, static dividers).
5. **Scopes on every variable** — NEVER leave as `ALL_SCOPES`. Background: `FRAME_FILL, SHAPE_FILL`. Text: `TEXT_FILL`. Border: `STROKE_COLOR`. Spacing: `GAP`. Radii: `CORNER_RADIUS`. Primitives: `[]` (hidden).
6. **Code syntax on every variable** — WEB syntax MUST use the `var()` wrapper: `var(--color-bg-primary)`, not `--color-bg-primary`. Use the actual CSS variable name from the codebase. ANDROID/iOS do NOT use a wrapper.
7. **Alias semantics to primitives** — `{ type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS', id: primitiveVar.id }`. Never duplicate raw values in semantic layer.
8. **Position variants after combineAsVariants** — they stack at (0,0). Manually grid-layout + resize.
9. **INSTANCE_SWAP for icons** — never create a variant per icon. Cap variant matrices: if Size × Style × State > 30 combinations, split into sub-component.
10. **Deterministic naming** — use consistent, unique node names for idempotent cleanup and resumability. Track created node IDs via return values and the state ledger.
11. **No destructive cleanup** — cleanup scripts identify nodes by name convention or returned IDs, not by guessing.
12. **Validate before proceeding** — never build on unvalidated work. `get_metadata` after every create, `get_screenshot` after each component.
13. **NEVER parallelize `use_figma` calls** — Figma state mutations must be strictly sequential. Even if your tool supports parallel calls, never run two use_figma calls simultaneously.
14. **Never hallucinate Node IDs** — always read IDs from the state ledger returned by previous calls. Never reconstruct or guess an ID from memory.
15. **Use the helper scripts** — embed scripts from `scripts/` into your use_figma calls. Don't write 200-line inline scripts from scratch.

---

## 4. State Management (Required for Long Workflows)

> Do not store workflow state on Figma objects. Use deterministic names for discovery and exact returned IDs in the state ledger. Put human-readable component purpose and usage guidance in the component or component-set `description`.

| Entity type | Stable identity | How to check existence |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Pages and frames | Deterministic name + state-ledger ID | `figma.root.children.find(p => p.name === pageName)` or `await figma.getNodeByIdAsync(id)` |
| Components and component sets | Variant/set name + state-ledger ID | `page.findOne(n => n.name === name)` or `await figma.getNodeByIdAsync(id)` |
| Variables | Name within collection | `(await figma.variables.getLocalVariablesAsync()).find(v => v.name === name && v.variableCollectionId === collId)` |
| Styles | Name | `getLocalTextStyles().find(s => s.name === name)` |

Record every returned ID in the state ledger immediately after creation. Never use a fuzzy lookup to authorize deletion.

**State persistence**: Do NOT rely solely on conversation context for the state ledger. Write it to disk:
```
/tmp/design-system-state-{RUN_ID}.json
```
Re-read this file at the start of every turn. In long workflows, conversation context will be truncated — the file is the source of truth.

Maintain a state ledger tracking:
```json
{
  "runId": "ds-build-2024-001",
  "phase": "phase3",
  "step": "component-button",
  "entities": {
    "collections": { "primitives": "id:...", "color": "id:..." },
    "variables": { "color/bg/primary": "id:...", "spacing/sm": "id:..." },
    "pages": { "Cover": "id:...", "Button": "id:..." },
    "components": { "Button": "id:..." }
  },
  "pendingValidations": ["Button:screenshot"],
  "completedSteps": ["phase0", "phase1", "phase2", "component-avatar"]
}
```

**Idempotency check** before every create: query by name + state ledger ID. If exists, skip or update — never duplicate.

**Resume protocol**: at session start or after context truncation, run a read-only `use_figma` to scan all pages, components, variables, and styles by name to reconstruct the `{key → id}` map. Then re-read the state file from disk if available.

**Continuation prompt** (give this to the user when resuming in a new chat):
> "I'm continuing a design system build. Run ID: {RUN_ID}. Load the figma-generate-library skill and resume from the last completed step."

## 5. Library Discovery and search_design_system — Reuse Decision Matrix

Search FIRST in Phase 0, then again immediately before each component creation.

Before calling `search_design_system` for a target file, you MUST call `get_libraries` first for that file. You MUST NOT assume libraries are added or available.

An empty `get_libraries` result does NOT excuse skipping the search — it only means you have no library keys to scope with. `get_libraries` paginates (community UI kits appear only on the first page, org libraries page in batches of 20), so empty lists are not proof that no library exists. How to act on the result:

- **Libraries returned** — run `search_design_system` scoped with `includeLibraryKeys`. Libraries in `libraries_available_to_add` are NOT searched by default; pass their `libraryKey`s to reach them.
- **No libraries returned** — still run `search_design_system`, but omit `includeLibraryKeys`. Omitting it scopes the search to the file itself, which is exactly what you want when discovery returned nothing to scope by.

Only once the search itself comes back empty may you record "no design system assets available" in the Phase 0f gap analysis and build from code tokens. Never infer "no libraries" from a failed or unattempted `get_libraries` call.

```
// Discover all libraries accessible to the file
get_libraries({ fileKey })
// Returns:
//   libraries_added_to_file: [{ name, libraryKey, description, source }, ...]
//   libraries_available_to_add: [{ name, libraryKey, description, source }, ...]
//   libraries_available_to_add_next_offset: number | null
```

Use the returned `libraryKey` values to scope searches to specific libraries via `includeLibraryKeys`. This avoids noisy results when many libraries are available.

If `libraries_available_to_add_next_offset` is non-null, more org libraries are available — call `get_libraries` again with `offset` set to that value. Org libraries page in batches of 20; community UI kits only appear on the first page.

```
// Search across all libraries (default)
search_design_system({ query, fileKey, includeComponents: true, includeVariables: true, includeStyles: true })

// Search within a specific library only
search_design_system({ query, fileKey, includeLibraryKeys: ["lk-abc123..."], includeComponents: true })
```

**Reuse if** all of these are true:
- Component property API matches your needs (same variant axes, compatible types)
- Token binding model is compatible (uses same or aliasable variables)
- Naming conventions match the target file
- Component is editable (not locked in a remote library you don't own)

**Rebuild if** any of these:
- API incompatibility (different property names, wrong variant model)
- Token model incompatible (hardcoded values, different variable schema)
- Ownership issue (can't modify the library)

**Wrap if** visual match but API incompatible:
- Import the library component as a nested instance inside a new wrapper component
- Expose a clean API on the wrapper

**Priority order**: local existing → subscribed library import → unsubscribed UI Kit library from `libraries_available_to_add` (icons especially) → create new.

---

## 6. Decision Forks

Ask when an unresolved choice materially changes the requested design, authority, or compatibility. Reuse the codebase, Figma file, prior choices, and authorized scope. Resolve routine reversible implementation choices with judgment; do not require a new approval at every fork.

**When NOT to ask:** if exactly one path is clearly correct from the source of truth (code, Figma file, agreed plan), take it. This section is for genuine ambiguity, not for offloading every decision.

| Fork situation | What to surface | Example ask |
|---|---|---|
| Code ≠ Figma on a token, component, or value | Both versions side by side, with provenance (file/line vs node) | "Code says `--color-bg-primary = #FFFFFF`, Figma has `color/bg/primary = #FAFAFA`. Which wins?" |
| Subscribed library has a close-but-not-exact match | Library component summary + gap list | "Library has `Button` with no `loading` state. Reuse + wrap locally, or rebuild from scratch?" |
| Scope ambiguity at plan-lock (0d) | What's clearly in, what's clearly out, what's ambiguous | "Spec lists `Button` and `Input`; `Field` is referenced but not defined. In or out of v1?" |

**If the user rejects an option you already built on:** fix before moving on. Never build on rejected work.

---

## 7. Naming Conventions

Match existing file conventions. If starting fresh:

**Variables** (slash-separated):
```
color/bg/primary     color/text/secondary    color/border/default
spacing/xs  spacing/sm  spacing/md  spacing/lg  spacing/xl  spacing/2xl
radius/none  radius/sm  radius/md  radius/lg  radius/full
typography/body/font-size    typography/heading/line-height
```

**Primitives**: `blue/50` → `blue/900`, `gray/50` → `gray/900`

**Component names**: `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Avatar`, `Badge`, `Checkbox`, `Toggle`

**Variant names**: `Property=Value, Property=Value` — e.g., `Size=Medium, Style=Primary, State=Default`

**Page separators**: `---` (most common) or `——— COMPONENTS ———`

## 8. Token Architecture

| Complexity | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| < 50 tokens | Single collection, 2 modes (Light/Dark) |
| 50–200 tokens | **Standard**: Primitives (1 mode) + Color semantic (Light/Dark) + Spacing (1 mode) + Typography (1 mode) |
| 200+ tokens | **Advanced**: Multiple semantic collections, 4–8 modes (Light/Dark × Contrast × Brand). See M3 pattern in [token-creation.md](references/token-creation.md) |

Standard pattern (recommended starting point):
```
Collection: "Primitives"    modes: ["Value"]
  blue/500 = #3B82F6, gray/900 = #111827, ...

Collection: "Color"         modes: ["Light", "Dark"]
  color/bg/primary → Light: alias Primitives/white, Dark: alias Primitives/gray-900
  color/text/primary → Light: alias Primitives/gray-900, Dark: alias Primitives/white

Collection: "Spacing"       modes: ["Value"]
  spacing/xs = 4, spacing/sm = 8, spacing/md = 16, ...
```

## 9. Per-Phase Anti-Patterns

**Phase 0 anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Starting to create anything before scope is locked with user
- ❌ Ignoring existing file conventions and imposing new ones
- ❌ Skipping `search_design_system` before planning component creation

**Phase 1 anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Using `ALL_SCOPES` on any variable
- ❌ Duplicating raw values in semantic layer instead of aliasing
- ❌ Not setting code syntax (breaks Dev Mode and round-tripping)
- ❌ Creating component tokens before agreeing on token taxonomy

**Phase 2 anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Skipping the cover page or foundations docs
- ❌ Putting multiple unrelated components on one page

**Phase 3 anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Creating components before foundations exist
- ❌ Hardcoding any fill/stroke/spacing/radius value in a component
- ❌ Creating a variant per icon (use INSTANCE_SWAP instead)
- ❌ Not positioning variants after combineAsVariants (they all stack at 0,0)
- ❌ Building variant matrix > 30 without splitting (variant explosion)
- ❌ Importing remote components then immediately detaching them

**General anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Retrying a failed script without understanding the error first
- ❌ Using name-prefix matching for cleanup (deletes user-owned nodes)
- ❌ Building on unvalidated work from the previous step
- ❌ Parallelizing use_figma calls (always sequential)
- ❌ Guessing/hallucinating node IDs from memory (always read from state ledger)
- ❌ Writing massive inline scripts instead of using the provided helper scripts
- ❌ Starting Phase 3 because the user said "build the button" without completing Phases 0-2

|--------|---------|
| [inspectFileStructure.js](scripts/inspectFileStructure.js) | Discover all pages, components, variables, styles; returns full inventory |
| [createVariableCollection.js](scripts/createVariableCollection.js) | Create a named collection with modes; returns `{collectionId, modeIds}` |
| [createSemanticTokens.js](scripts/createSemanticTokens.js) | Create aliased semantic variables from a token map |
| [createComponentWithVariants.js](scripts/createComponentWithVariants.js) | Build a component set from a variant matrix; handles grid layout |
| [bindVariablesToComponent.js](scripts/bindVariablesToComponent.js) | Bind design tokens to all component visual properties |
| [createDocumentationPage.js](scripts/createDocumentationPage.js) | Create a page with title + description + section structure |
| [validateCreation.js](scripts/validateCreation.js) | Verify created nodes match expected counts, names, structure |
| [cleanupOrphans.js](scripts/cleanupOrphans.js) | Remove only the exact node, variable, and collection IDs supplied from the state ledger |
